# Company-Project
This is a project that simulates a company.

In this project we have three views.
Administrator view, Capturista view, technical view.
In the Administrator view, we can see and manage everything that workers do and register employees.
In the Capturista view, we can register clients with any errors / problems they have and see the solution that the technicians gave.
And in the technical view, we can see the errors / problems that exist and correct them.
In the project I used the MVC pattern design
