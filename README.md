# Company-Project
This is a project that simulates a company.

In this project we have three views.
Administrator view, grabber view, technical view.
In the Administrator view, we can see and manage everything that workers do.
In the Capturer view, they can register clients with any errors / problems they have.
And in the technical view, they can see the errors / problems that exist and correct them.
In the project I used the MVC pattern design
